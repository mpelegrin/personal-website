            <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
            <div class="half-width">
              <p>I've made my home base in Monument, Colorado, after spending my childhood
                traveling around the world as the daughter of a military officer.
                My journey into tech has morphed from earning a bachelors degree in psychology and
                a master degree in social work. As I've worked on increasingly larger scales in social work,
                I am facinated with how tech can help spread education and resources to more people.
                I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own sites to reach a larger audience.
              </p>

            <div class="half-width">
              <p>That curiosity has opened a door that can never be shut.
                When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found
                something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking
                for in my work. Entering the world of tech, I am motivated to
                use my communication and organizational skills from social work to create
                user-friendly websites and write clean, elegant code.

              <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
              <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by
                hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to
                collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

              <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
              <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build
                on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make
                it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

              <h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
              <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly &
                accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect
                match.
